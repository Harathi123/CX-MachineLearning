# CX-MachineLearning
CX MachineLearning is an open sourced project built on top of Python 3.6 and MongoDB 3.2. The aim is to design and construct a fully optimised and elaborate library to track online consumer/user behavior, habits and make predictive analysis &amp; projects.

## Project Objectives
- To build a Machine Learning programme for tracking consumer's behaviors,
purchasing habits, preferences, user journeys and ultimately provide
predictive models and recommendations.

- Purely for research purpose, this project aims to help other developers
learning Python and Machine Learning to get acquainted with Machine
Learning concepts from an *"by the example"* approach.

- The objective of this project is to create an AI backbone that will
be fully automated and self-learning.

- To continuously seek the improvement of the library's codes (algorithms)
to ensure that the project is constantly up to date with framework updates
and coding efficiency.

- With the Machine Learning and simulated data completed, the goal is to
create a real-time dashboard that allows learners and educators to demonstrate
the capabilities of good machine learning application. With the Web API,
any development team can make use of the project to create their own dashboards,
or modify it for their school/research/commercial use.

## Where We Are Currently
Firstly, if you are here reading this documentation and introduction
to CX-MachineLearning Research Project, then my guess is you are
either keen to be a part of this project, or you like to follow on
our research progress. Alternatively, you might be an individual,
or representing an organization or educational institution seeking
to invest/sponsor a research program.

CX-MachineLearning as you can already see is currently in its infancy
stage. Like how a baby is still forming in the womb of their mother.
We are currently growing our research team and will eventually release
a timeline of projected deliverables (releases) for CX-MachineLearning.

We are also seeking funding & sponsorships that can help us with our
research efforts. On top of which, we will also be relying on the
kind and generous donations of those in the community who believes in
the direction that we are taking with this research program.

## 3 Key Components of CX-MachineLearning
- MongoDB 3.2 Server
- Main Project (Python 3.6 + Flask-PyMongo)
    - ExMachina (main AI library)
    - Web API (using Flask-PyMongo)
- Real-time Dashboard (In the near future)

### A Peak Into the Future
- ChatBots (Automated [Human-like] Customer Service) - using Natural
Language Processing
- Predictive Analysis & Projections
- Many more

Apart from the existing plans to design, build and release the first
version of CX-MachineLearning, we have a long term plan to integrate
more aspects of Artificial Intelligence into our project, or
project(s). CX-MachineLearning will serve as a starting point for
Machine Learning engineers and Customer Experience professionals to
explore the possibilities of what can be achieved.

## Looking to Collaborate?
If you are looking for an opportunity to collaborate on an open
sourced project using Python and MongoDB, you are welcomed to write in
to our team. We need folks for various aspects of the project:

- Machine Learning Hackers (coders basically)
- Data Scientist (even aspiring ones are welcomed, provided you know
your stuff)
- Creating of real-life simulated data (MongoDB skills required)
- Web API
- Regular updating of our documentation and API content. (Fluent with
Markdown syntax)

## Support Our Project by Donating
Like every other open sourced project, we are a bunch of folks from
all walks of life coming together to make this project a success.
Our goal is to keep the highest of standards for this project
eventhough it is free for all. We do not stand to gain anything
monetary out of this project, hence every bit of funds we receive
through you kindest donation will proceed straight into financing
the research and development of this project. All it takes is just
**USD$5**. Click the Paypal donate button below to make your donation
today.

## Research Funding and Sponsorships
We are also actively in the search and lookout for opportunities to
acquire constant research funding and/or sponsorships. Terms and
agreements of those funding and sponsorships can be negotiated. As a
general rule of thumb, the research project's leadership holds the
final decision on the direction of the research as it is our aim to
follow what is trending within our world today.

If you are an organisation or educational institution that is keen to
provide sponsorship for our research programme, please kindly reach out
to our Research Lead, Sherman to set up a discussion.
